This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data.

The site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The steps include
I. set working directory
II. Read data from the files into the variables
III.  Merge the data tables by rows
IV. Set names to variable before merge and labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
V. Merge the data tables by columns
VI. Subset Name of Features by measurements on the mean and standard deviation
VII. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
VIII. creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
